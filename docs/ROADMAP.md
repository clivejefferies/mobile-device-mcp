# Mobile Debug MCP Roadmap

## Planning Principles

Ordered by:


1. Impact on agent reliability  
2. Reduction in retries / brittleness  
3. Breadth of app coverage improved  
4. Implementation complexity vs payoff

## Capability Status Definitions

- **Completed**  
  Capability implemented and considered part of the baseline platform.

- **Spec Ready**  
  Capability design or RFC is mature and implementation-ready, but not yet delivered.

- **Planned**  
  Capability is prioritized on the roadmap, but detailed specification and/or implementation work remains ahead.

## Program-Level Success Metrics
Track roadmap impact across releases using:

- Retry reduction rate (% fewer action retries per task)
- Element match success rate (% successful element targeting)
- Verification success rate (% expect_* checks passing first attempt)
- Wait success rate for asynchronous UI flows
- Custom control interaction success rate
- Gesture success rate
- Mean time to root cause during debugging
- Overall agent task completion rate

Primary KPI:
Higher task success with fewer retries.

## Expected Impact
Very high.

## Exit Criteria

# Wait and Synchronization Reliability

## Rationale
Reliable async synchronization is foundational for agent success and should precede gesture expansion.

- skip UI waits after actions
- rely on network/log signals too early
- struggle with in-place UI updates
- misread stale UI snapshots

## Scope
- UI-first synchronization policy guidance

## Dependencies
Depends on:
- Stronger State Verification
- Richer Element Identity

Blocks or strengthens:
- Better Compose / Custom Control Semantics
- Action Trace Correlation

# Actionability Resolution

## Rationale
Reduces failures caused by interacting with discoverable but non-actionable UI nodes.

Addresses cases where:
- visible text is not the true click target
- child nodes differ from actionable containers
- affordance exists but handler ownership is ambiguous

## Scope
- Actionable container resolution

- Actionability confidence metadata
- Post-action state verification integration

## Expected Impact
High.

## Exit Criteria

# Adjustable Control Support

## Rationale
High leverage improvement for sliders and parameterized controls.

**Status:** Planned

Addresses friction around:
- coordinate-calibrated slider interaction
- snapping and quantized controls
- weak state confirmation after adjustment

## Scope
New semantic control support:

```json
set_slider_value(target, value, tolerance?)
```

Includes:
- semantic adjustable control manipulation
- read-back verification loop
- tolerance-aware value setting
- fallback coordinate calibration only when needed

## Expected Impact
High.

## Exit Criteria
- Adjustable control primitive implemented
- Verification loop reads and confirms resulting values
- Tolerance model defined
- Benchmark slider/custom control flows validated

## Success Metrics
- Higher custom control interaction success rate

# Signal-Oriented Diagnostic Filtering

## Rationale
Improves observability by separating causal signals from diagnostic noise.

**Status:** Planned

Addresses friction from:
- noisy log streams
- weak signal extraction
- difficult action-to-signal attribution

## Scope
- Structured diagnostic classification
- Noise filtering heuristics
- Signal relevance scoring
- App vs system event tagging

## Expected Impact
High.

## Exit Criteria
- Diagnostic signal classification model defined
- Noise filtering available in representative flows
- Relevant action-linked signals surfaced separately from background noise
- Debug workflows validated with filtered signals

## Success Metrics
- Lower time-to-root-cause

# Long Press Gesture

## Rationale
High utility, relatively low complexity.

**Status:** Planned

Unlocks many currently awkward interactions:

- context menus
- hidden actions
- reorder handles
- press-and-hold controls

Broad usefulness.

## Scope
New tool:

```json
long_press(element_id, duration_ms?)
```

Verification alignment:
- expect_context_menu
- expect_press_effect

## Expected Impact
High.

# Better Compose / Custom Control Semantics

## Rationale
Important, but strengthened by earlier capabilities first.

**Status:** Planned

Semantics become more useful once:
- identity is stronger
- verification is stronger
- gestures are richer
- synchronization is more reliable
- action execution is more precise

## Scope
- Composite control traits
- Control role enrichment (adjustable, expandable, selectable_group)
- Interaction contracts metadata
- Custom widget gesture affordance hints

## Expected Impact
High.

- Interaction contracts surfaced in snapshot model
- Confidence model defined for derived semantics
- Custom control manipulation success validated in benchmark flows

# Pinch to Zoom

## Rationale

- maps
- images
- canvases
- zoomable custom surfaces

Useful, but less universal.

## Scope

```json
pinch_to_zoom(target, scale, center?)
```

Verification:
- expect_zoom_level
- expect_viewport_change

## Expected Impact
Medium-high.

Depends on:

Very valuable for debugging,
but less critical than improving control success first.

## Expected Impact
Medium-high.

## Exit Criteria
- Action correlation model defined
- UI/network/log linkage captured for representative actions
