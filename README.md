# Mobile Debug MCP

A minimal, secure MCP server for AI-assisted mobile development. Build, install, and inspect Android/iOS apps from an MCP-compatible client.

> **Note:** iOS support is currently an untested Work In Progress (WIP). Please use with caution and report any issues.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- Android SDK (adb) for Android support
- Xcode command-line tools for iOS support
- idb for iOS device support

## Configuration example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobile-debug": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes","mobile-debug-mcp","server"],
      "env": { "ADB_PATH": "/path/to/adb", "XCRUN_PATH": "/usr/bin/xcrun", "IDB_PATH": "/path/to/idb" }
    }
  }
}
```
## Usage

Example: 
After a crash tell the agent the following:

I have a crash on the app, can you diagnose it, fix and validate using the mcp tools available

## IDB/ADB healthcheck and diagnostics

The agent provides healthcheck and optional auto-install scripts for iOS (idb) and Android (adb).

- Run `npm run healthcheck` to verify idb is available. Set `MCP_AUTO_INSTALL_IDB=true` to allow the installer to run in CI or non-interactive environments.
- Override detection with `IDB_PATH` or `ADB_PATH` environment variables.
- Tools now return structured diagnostics on failures: { exitCode, stdout, stderr, command, args, envSnapshot, suggestedFixes } which helps agents decide corrective actions.
